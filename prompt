Analyze the provided image of the network topology and extract the necessary details to generate configuration commands using Cisco syntax based on the user's input keyword: "{required}".

Device Count: Identify and list all devices in the topology, including the number of routers, switches, computers, and interfaces.

Device Naming: If the devices are not named in the image, assign generic names such as Router1, Switch1, PC1, etc. For multiple devices of the same type, continue numbering them sequentially (e.g., Switch2, Router3).

Interface Details: If interface names (e.g., Fa 0/0, Gig 0/1, Se 2/0) are visible in the image, use those. If they are unclear, infer the interface names based on standard topology configurations, or ask the user to provide the missing details if needed.

IP Addresses & Network Configuration: For each device:

Identify the IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways for computers.
For routers and switches, configure the relevant interfaces (FastEthernet, Serial, etc.) with IP addressing and routing details.
Command Shortcuts: Use appropriate command shortcuts to streamline the configurations where possible, ensuring efficiency without sacrificing clarity.

Routing & Connectivity: Provide necessary routing configurations (e.g., static or dynamic) to ensure end-to-end connectivity in the topology.

Output Organization: Organize the output by device, following this format:

Device1 Configuration:
Access the device's CLI.
Start with interface configurations (Serial, FastEthernet, etc.).
Apply routing configurations where applicable.
Ensure all interfaces are activated (use no shutdown).
Provide a summary of the routing setup and IP scheme.
Example:


Router1 Configuration:
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# interface serial 2/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 209.165.200.225 255.255.255.252
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config)# interface fastethernet 0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
Router(config)# ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 209.165.200.226
Clarifications: If you are unsure about certain details in the topology (e.g., specific interface types or IP schemes), ask the user for clarification before proceeding.
